# GroundWar
Little 2d Shooter thing

2 - 22 - 22

Welcome to Ground War!

This project is intented to explore the variety in 2D game development, and to experiment on how fun a shooter can be in 2 dimensions. This is an experiment in single player mechanics and AI designed to take different or unique paths to their objectives. Rather than making a beeline for the flag, or simply sitting right on the objective, this game tries to use several different variables to try and make a more authentic feel. Different choices and paths to the same objective will keep the game fresh and keep YOU on your toes. 

To build, edit build.bat and run. To compile to jar, edit release.bat and run.
